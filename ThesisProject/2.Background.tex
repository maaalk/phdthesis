\section{Project-based Learning - PBL}

Project-based learning (PBL) is a comprehensive approach to classroom teaching and learning where students are engaged in the investigation of realistic problems, and they learn by working on an open-ended project, discovering problems and finding solutions as they go along. (Blumenfeld91, Jazayeri15). Bender (Bender12) describes PBL as an instructional model based on having students confront real-world issues and problems that they find meaningful, determine how to address them, and then act in a collaborative fashion to create problem solutions. In PBL, the instructor has a less central role, acting as a guide, and students take more responsibility for their own learning, which results in higher student involvement (Martin14, Jazayeri15).
